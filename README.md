# AI Smart Alarm

## Overview
AI Smart Alarm is an intelligent alarm system designed to eliminate oversleeping by enforcing physical wake-up actions. Unlike traditional alarms, this system uses computer vision to ensure the user is awake and active before the alarm can be dismissed.

It combines real-time object detection with a strict no-snooze mechanism, making it a practical productivity tool.

## Features
- AI-based wake verification using object detection  
- Webcam-based real-time monitoring  
- No snooze system (forces action to stop alarm)  
- Fast and responsive detection pipeline

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Node.js (v16+)
- npm or yarn

---

## Installation

### Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/ilesh18/smart-alarm.git

cd ai-smart-alarm

---

### Backend Setup
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py

Backend runs on:

http://localhost:5000


---

### Frontend Setup

cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev


Frontend runs on:

http://localhost:5173

## How It Works
1. User sets an alarm  
2. Alarm triggers and activates webcam  
3. YOLOv8 detects required object/action  
4. Alarm stops only after successful detection
